note : 

1. In Libraries remove "mysql-connector-java-8.0.17/mysql-connector-java-8.0.17.jar" and add your mysql connector to Library

2. If you are using old jdk version then modify "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" to "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" in DBconnection.java (because "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" is depreciated)
